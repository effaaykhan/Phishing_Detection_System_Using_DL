# Phishing_Detection_System_Using_DL
This is a URL-Based Phishing Detection System developed using deep learning architectures like LSTM and CNN. In simple words this model takes the URL as input and based on the trained model it classifies whether the URL is legitimate or Phishing. Results:
Accuracy : 99.34%
F1-Score : 99.34%
Recall   : 98.83%
Precision: 99.86%
